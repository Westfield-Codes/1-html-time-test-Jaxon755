    <h1>Three Ways of Looking at Time</h1>
    An expansion upon <a href="https://www.theperspective.com/debates/living/perspective-time-linear-cyclical">The Perspective On Time.</a> . 
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    Astronomers, archaeologists and theologians, among many others, have pondered the nature and meaning of “time.”  We all know what time is until someone asks us to define it.  During the pandemic, when people all over the world stayed at home for extended periods of time, we had nothing but time on our hands to ponder the nature of time as we perceive it. Is it linear, cyclical, or spiral?  While many people in the modern era seem to agree that time is linear, for most of humankind’s existence, time has been considered cyclical and rhythmic.
    <h3>Three Arguments</h3>
<ol>
<li>Time is Linear</li>
<ul>
<li>Time is Irreversible</li>
<li>Time is Cumulative</li>
</ul>
<li>Time is Cyclical</li>
<ul>
<li>Planets Mark Time</li>
<li>Seasons Mark Time</li>
</ul>
<li>Time is Spiral</li>
<ul>
<li>Both at Once</li>
<li>Holidays Happen</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<h2>Time is Linear</h2>
